## Intro
1.  Program — a set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do.
    Helps you do things that might take very long to do maually.
    As programing goes more complex you’re building your own maze, in a way, and you might just get lost in it.
2.  In a machine—lots of separate parts tend to be involved, and to make the whole thing
    tick, we have to consider the ways in which these parts interconnect and contribute to the operation of the whole. A computer is a physical machine that acts as a host for these immaterial machines. A program can ingeniously combine an enormous number of these simple actions to do very complicated things.
3.  The art of programing is the skill of controlling complexity. The earlier program   
    with zeros and ones, with puchcard very high probability of  error. Program allows  user to make their own building blocks.
4.  JavaScript is ridiculously liberal in what it allows. The idea behind this design 
    was that it would make programming in JavaScript easier for beginners.

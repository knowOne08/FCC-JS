=============

1. The scope of let is limited to the block.
2. Object.freeze to prevent data mutation. Like keeping the constants unchanged
3. Use Arrow Functions to Write Concise Anonymous Functions. Making anonymous functions using [const funName = () =>{//code} ]
4. You can also pass arguments into arrow function.
5. Default parameters in arrow functions.
6.  Rest parameter for function parameters. With the rest parameter, you can create functions that take a variable number of arguments. These arguments are stored in an array that can be accessed later from inside the function. [funName(...args)].
7. the spread operator, which allows us to expand arrays and other expressions in places where multiple parameters or elements are expected.[...]
8. Use Destructuring Assignment to Extract Values from Objects [const {var1 ,var 2} = var]
9.  Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Arrays. [a,b] = [b,a]
10. Template literal is a special type of string that makes creating complex strings easier(like format string in python).
11. Shorthand functions insdide a object.
12. Making classes  using class keyword.
13. imports and exports with different syntax.
14. Export  defaults.
15.  you use PROMISE to make a promise to do something, usually asynchronously. When the task completes, you either fulfill your promise or fail to do so
16. the test() method.

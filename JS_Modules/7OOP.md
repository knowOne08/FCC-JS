## Object Oriented Programing JS

1.  objects: tangible things people can observe and interact with.
    a object is like the name object like book, bike, car, bus etc. which has specific key-value pairs.
    ```javascript
    //simple object in js
    let dog = {
        name : "Dan",
        numLegs : 4
    }
    ```
    
2.  Acessing object properties using . methood
    ```javascript
    let dog = {
    name: "Spot",
    numLegs: 4
    };
    // Only change code below this line
    console.log(dog.name)
    ```

3.  Methods are properties that are functions. This adds different behavior to an object.
    ```javascript
    let dog = {
    name: "Spot",
    numLegs: 4,
    sayLegs: () => "This dog has 4 legs."

    };

    dog.sayLegs();
    ```

4.  You can also use objects properties inside an object method using **this.method()** 
    property.
    ```javascript
    let dog = {
    name: "Spot",
    numLegs: 4,
    sayLegs: function() {return "This dog has " + this.numLegs + " legs.";}
    };

    dog.sayLegs();
    ```

5.  Constructors as the name are functions that are used  to creat new     
    objects.
    ->  Constructors are defined with a capitalized name to distinguish them from other 
        functions that are not constructors.
    ->  Constructors use the keyword this to set properties of the object they will 
        create. Inside the constructor, this refers to the new object it will create.
    ->  Constructors define properties and behaviors instead of returning a value as   
        other 
        functions might.
    ```javascript
    function Dog(){
    this.name ='dog',
    this.color='blue',
    this.numLegs= 5
    }
    ```

6.  ***.this*** inside the constructor always refers to the object being created.
    Creating instances of object created.
    ```javascript
    function Dog() {
    this.name = "Rupert";
    this.color = "brown";
    this.numLegs = 4;
    }
    // Only change code below this line
    let hound = new Dog();
    ```

7.  Making constructor to accept parameters
    ```javascript
    function Dog() {
    this.name = "Rupert";
    this.color = "brown";
    this.numLegs = 4;
    }
    // Only change code below this line
    let hound = new Dog();
    ```

8.  New object created by constuctor is called the instance of the constructor.
    ***instanceof*** allows you to compare an object to a constructor, returning true or false based on whether or not that object was created with the constructor. 
    ```javascript
    function House(numBedrooms) {
    this.numBedrooms = numBedrooms;
    }

    // Only change code below this line
    let myHouse = new House(2);

    myHouse instanceof House;
    ```

9.  The property directly defined on instance object are called **Own Properties**
    ```javascript
    function Bird(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.numLegs = 2;
    }

    let canary = new Bird("Tweety");
    let ownProps = [];
    // Only change code below this line
    for(let property in canary){
    if(canary.hasOwnProperty(property)){
        ownProps.push(property);
    }
    }
    console.log(ownProps);
    ```

10. Use Prototype Properties to Reduce Duplicate Code.
    Properties in the prototype are shared among ALL instances of Constructor.
    ```javascript
    function Dog(name) {
    this.name = name;
    }


    Dog.prototype.numLegs = 2;
    // Only change code above this line
    let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");
    ```

11. Adding all properties to array (both own property and prototype property)
    ```Javascript
    function Dog(name) {
    this.name = name;
    }

    Dog.prototype.numLegs = 4;

    let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

    let ownProps = [];
    let prototypeProps = [];

    // Only change code below this line
    for(let property in beagle){
    if(beagle.hasOwnProperty(property)){
        ownProps.push(property);
    }else{
        prototypeProps.push(property);
    }
    }
    console.log(ownProps);
    console.log(prototypeProps);

    ```

12. Constructor property of an instance.
    **Note:** Since the constructor property can be overwritten (which will be covered in the next two challenges) itâ€™s generally better to use the instanceof method to check the type of an object.
    ```Javascript
    function Dog(name) {
    this.name = name;
    }

    // Only change code below this line
    function joinDogFraternity(candidate) {
    if(candidate.constructor === Dog){
        return true;
    }else{
        return false;
    }
    }
    ```

13. You can add prototype  properties all at once rather than adding single property 
    each time. 
    ```Javascript
    function Dog(name) {
    this.name = name;
    }

    Dog.prototype = {
    // Only change code below this line
    numLegs: 2,
    eat: () => {console.log("eat")},
    describe: () => {console.log("name is " + this.name)}
    };
    ```

14. Manually setting the prototype to a new object erases the constructor property.This 
    property can be used to check which constructor function created the instance, but since the property has been overwritten, it now gives false results.
    ```Javascript
    function Dog(name) {
    this.name = name;
    }

    // Only change code below this line
    Dog.prototype = {

    constructor: Dog, //Constructor property on Dog prototype
    numLegs: 4,
    eat: function() {
        console.log("nom nom nom");
    },
    describe: function() {
        console.log("My name is " + this.name);
    }
    };

    let dog = new Dog();

    ```

15. An object inherits its prototype directly from the constructor function that created 
    it. 
    We can check this by ***.isPrototypeOf*** method
    ```Javascript
    function Dog(name) {
    this.name = name;
    }

    let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

    // Only change code below this line

    Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(beagle)
    ```

16. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle. 
    If you have a block of code which is common in all the objects you can define it in parent object(supertype).
    ```javascript
    function Animal(){ };
    Animal.prototype = {
    constructor: Animal,
    eat: () => {return "nom nom nom"}
    }
    function Cat(name) {
    this.name = name;
    }

    Cat.prototype = {
    constructor: Cat
    };

    function Bear(name) {
    this.name = name;
    }

    Bear.prototype = {
    constructor: Bear,
    };

    ```

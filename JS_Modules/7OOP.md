## Object Oriented Programing JS

1.  objects: tangible things people can observe and interact with.
    a object is like the name object like book, bike, car, bus etc. which has specific key-value pairs.
    ```javascript
    //simple object in js
    let dog = {
        name : "Dan",
        numLegs : 4
    }
    ```
    
2.  Acessing object properties using . methood
    ```javascript
    let dog = {
    name: "Spot",
    numLegs: 4
    };
    // Only change code below this line
    console.log(dog.name)
    ```

3.  Methods are properties that are functions. This adds different behavior to an object.
    ```javascript
    let dog = {
    name: "Spot",
    numLegs: 4,
    sayLegs: () => "This dog has 4 legs."

    };

    dog.sayLegs();
    ```

4.  You can also use objects properties inside an object method using **this.method()** 
    property.
    ```javascript
    let dog = {
    name: "Spot",
    numLegs: 4,
    sayLegs: function() {return "This dog has " + this.numLegs + " legs.";}
    };

    dog.sayLegs();
    ```

5.  Constructors as the name are functions that are used  to creat new     
    objects.
    ->  Constructors are defined with a capitalized name to distinguish them from other 
        functions that are not constructors.
    ->  Constructors use the keyword this to set properties of the object they will 
        create. Inside the constructor, this refers to the new object it will create.
    ->  Constructors define properties and behaviors instead of returning a value as   
        other 
        functions might.
    ```javascript
    function Dog(){
    this.name ='dog',
    this.color='blue',
    this.numLegs= 5
    }
    ```

6.  ***.this*** inside the constructor always refers to the object being created.
    Creating instances of object created.
    ```javascript
    function Dog() {
    this.name = "Rupert";
    this.color = "brown";
    this.numLegs = 4;
    }
    // Only change code below this line
    let hound = new Dog();
    ```

7.  Making constructor to accept parameters
    ```javascript
    function Dog() {
    this.name = "Rupert";
    this.color = "brown";
    this.numLegs = 4;
    }
    // Only change code below this line
    let hound = new Dog();
    ```

8.  New object created by constuctor is called the instance of the constructor.
    ***instanceof*** allows you to compare an object to a constructor, returning true or false based on whether or not that object was created with the constructor. 
    ```javascript
    function House(numBedrooms) {
    this.numBedrooms = numBedrooms;
    }

    // Only change code below this line
    let myHouse = new House(2);

    myHouse instanceof House;
    ```

9.  The property directly defined on instance object are called **Own Properties**
    ```javascript
    function Bird(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.numLegs = 2;
    }

    let canary = new Bird("Tweety");
    let ownProps = [];
    // Only change code below this line
    for(let property in canary){
    if(canary.hasOwnProperty(property)){
        ownProps.push(property);
    }
    }
    console.log(ownProps);
    ```

10. Use Prototype Properties to Reduce Duplicate Code.
    Properties in the prototype are shared among ALL instances of Constructor.
    ```javascript
    function Dog(name) {
    this.name = name;
    }


    Dog.prototype.numLegs = 2;
    // Only change code above this line
    let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");
    ```

11. Adding all properties to array (both own property and prototype property)
    ```Javascript
    function Dog(name) {
    this.name = name;
    }

    Dog.prototype.numLegs = 4;

    let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

    let ownProps = [];
    let prototypeProps = [];

    // Only change code below this line
    for(let property in beagle){
    if(beagle.hasOwnProperty(property)){
        ownProps.push(property);
    }else{
        prototypeProps.push(property);
    }
    }
    console.log(ownProps);
    console.log(prototypeProps);

    ```

12. Constructor property of an instance.
    **Note:** Since the constructor property can be overwritten (which will be covered in the next two challenges) itâ€™s generally better to use the instanceof method to check the type of an object.
    ```Javascript
    function Dog(name) {
    this.name = name;
    }

    // Only change code below this line
    function joinDogFraternity(candidate) {
    if(candidate.constructor === Dog){
        return true;
    }else{
        return false;
    }
    }
    ```

13. You can add prototype  properties all at once rather than adding single property 
    each time. 
    ```Javascript
    function Dog(name) {
    this.name = name;
    }

    Dog.prototype = {
    // Only change code below this line
    numLegs: 2,
    eat: () => {console.log("eat")},
    describe: () => {console.log("name is " + this.name)}
    };
    ```

14. Manually setting the prototype to a new object erases the constructor property.This 
    property can be used to check which constructor function created the instance, but since the property has been overwritten, it now gives false results.
    ```Javascript
    function Dog(name) {
    this.name = name;
    }

    // Only change code below this line
    Dog.prototype = {

    constructor: Dog, //Constructor property on Dog prototype
    numLegs: 4,
    eat: function() {
        console.log("nom nom nom");
    },
    describe: function() {
        console.log("My name is " + this.name);
    }
    };

    let dog = new Dog();

    ```

15. An object inherits its prototype directly from the constructor function that created 
    it. 
    We can check this by ***.isPrototypeOf*** method
    ```Javascript
    function Dog(name) {
    this.name = name;
    }

    let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

    // Only change code below this line

    Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(beagle)
    ```

16. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle. 
    If you have a block of code which is common in all the objects you can define it in parent object(supertype).
    ```javascript
    function Animal(){ };
    Animal.prototype = {
    constructor: Animal,
    eat: () => {return "nom nom nom"}
    }
    function Cat(name) {
    this.name = name;
    }

    Cat.prototype = {
    constructor: Cat
    };

    function Bear(name) {
    this.name = name;
    }

    Bear.prototype = {
    constructor: Bear,
    };

    ```

17. Object.create(obj) creates a new object, and sets obj as the new object's prototype
    Thi will inherit all the properties from parent Object or supertype
    ```javascript
    function Animal() { }

    Animal.prototype = {
    constructor: Animal,
    eat: function() {
        console.log("nom nom nom");
    }
    };

    // Only change code below this line

    let duck = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
    let beagle = Object.create(Animal.prototype); 
    ```

18. Setting the Child's Prototype to an Instance of the Parent.
    ```javascript
    function Animal() { }

    Animal.prototype = {
    constructor: Animal,
    eat: function() {
        console.log("nom nom nom");
    }
    };

    function Dog() { }

    // Only change code below this line

    Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype)

    let beagle = new Dog();
    ```

19. When object inherits a prototype from supertype it also inherits its supertypes 
    Construction method.
    Manually setting the constructor property of Object to it supertype
    ```javascript
    function Animal() { }
    function Bird() { }
    function Dog() { }

    Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
    Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

    // Only change code below this line

    Bird.prototype.constructor = Bird;
    Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;

    let duck = new Bird();
    let beagle = new Dog();

    ```

20. Constructor function can still have its own methods in addition to inherited methods 
    from supertype
    ```javascript 
    function Animal() { }
    Animal.prototype.eat = function() { console.log("nom nom nom"); };

    function Dog() { }

    // Only change code below this line

    Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype)
    Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;
    Dog.prototype.bark = function() {
    console.log("Woof!");
    };
    // Only change code above this line

    let beagle = new Dog();
    ```

21. It's possible to override an inherited method.
    ```javascript
    function Bird() { }

    Bird.prototype.fly = function() { return "I am flying!"; };

    function Penguin() { }
    Penguin.prototype = Object.create(Bird.prototype);
    Penguin.prototype.constructor = Penguin;

    // Only change code below this line

    Penguin.prototype.fly = function() {
    return "Alas, this is a flightless bird.";
    };

    // Only change code above this line

    let penguin = new Penguin();
    console.log(penguin.fly());
    ```

23. Use a Mixin to Add Common Behavior Between Unrelated Objects
    ```javascript
    let bird = {
    name: "Donald",
    numLegs: 2
    };

    let boat = {
    name: "Warrior",
    type: "race-boat"
    };

    // Add your code below this line
    let glideMixin = function(obj) {
    obj.glide = function() {
        console.log("Gliding!");
    };
    };
    glideMixin(bird);
    glideMixin(boat);
    ```

24. Using Closure to Protect Properties Within an Object from Being Modified Externally
    ```javascript
    function Bird() {
  let weight = 15;

  this.getWeight = function() {
    return weight;
  };
    }

    ```

25. Immediately invoked function expression or IIFE.
    Executing function as soon as it is declared
    ```javascript
    (function () {
    console.log("A cozy nest is ready");
    })();


    ```

26. An immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) is often used to group related 
    functionality into a single object or module
    ```javascript
    
    let funModule = (function() {
    return {
        isCuteMixin: function(obj) {
        obj.isCute = function() {
            return true;
        };
        },
        singMixin: function(obj) {
        obj.sing = function() {
            console.log("Singing to an awesome tune");
        };
        }
    };
    })();
    ```
